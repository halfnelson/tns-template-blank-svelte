# NativeScript with Svelte Native Blank Template

App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-blank-svelte --template tns-template-blank-svelte
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-blank-svelte).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
tns create my-blank-svelte --template https://github.com/halfnelson/tns-template-blank-svelte
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!

## Walkthrough

### Architecture
The application root component is located at:
- `App.svelte`

**Home** page has the following components:
- `ActionBar` - It holds the title of the page.
- `GridLayout` - The main page layout that should contains all the page content.
